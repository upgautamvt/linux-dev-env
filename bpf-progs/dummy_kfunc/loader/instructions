Compile all the programs by running "make" from their corresponding directories' Makefile
For the kfunc_module, also do "insmod hello.ko"
use loader to attach the bpf program
    root@q:/linux-dev-env/bpf-progs/kfunc/loader# ./load.user ../bpf/kfunc.kern.o handle_kprobe
    PID: 548
Make sure, the bpf program is loaded (i.e., attached)
    root@q:/linux-dev-env# bpftool prog show
    5: kprobe  name handle_kprobe  tag f5d432c4ffce0ae6  gpl
